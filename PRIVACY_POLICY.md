# Privacy Policy for MultiChatbot Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: June 23, 2025**
This Privacy Policy explains how MultiChatbot ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our Chrome Extension (the "Extension").

The Extension does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or sensitive information. It operates entirely within your browser and does not interact with external servers or databases.
The Extension is designed to work primarily on your local computer.

## Information Handled Locally by the Extension
To provide its features, MultiChatbot accesses and stores some data directly on your computer using Chrome's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) and browser APIs. This data is **processed locally and is never sent to us or any third parties by the Extension.**

This locally stored data includes:
*   **Open Tab Information:**
    *   To display a list of your open browser tabs from which you can select chatbots, the Extension accesses tab details such as **URLs, titles, and favicons.**
    *   To enable sorting features, the Extension also keeps track of **when tabs are created and when they were last activated.**
    *   This information is used solely to populate the tab list in the Extension's interface and to sort it according to your preferences.
*   **Prompt History:** Prompts you send are saved locally to allow you to view and resend them later.
*   **Saved Prompts:** Prompts you choose to save are stored locally for easy access.
*   **Extension Settings:** Your preferences for the Extension's behavior (like sorting) are saved locally.

You can manage data like prompt history and saved prompts through the Extension's interface. Uninstalling the Extension will remove all its locally stored data.

## How Data Is Used

All data accessed and handled by the Extension is used **only** to make the Extension work on your computer as intended. This includes:
*   Displaying your open tabs so you can select them.
*   Sorting the list of tabs based on your settings.
*   Sending your prompts to the selected chatbot tabs.
*   Storing and displaying your prompt history and saved prompts.
*   Applying your chosen settings for the Extension.

## Third-Party Websites

MultiChatbot helps you send prompts to third-party chatbot websites (like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). Your interactions with these websites are governed by their own privacy policies. MultiChatbot only sends the prompt text you provide to these sites as instructed by you.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. If we do, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
