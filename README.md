# MultiChatbot Chrome Extension

MultiChatbot is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to interact with multiple web-applications of most popular LLMs (Large Language Models) from a single interface. The UI of an extension features a textbox that you can use to send the same prompt to several generative AI chatbots at the same time, as well as some additional features, such as ability to save you favorite prompts for later use, and prompt history.

**In development.**

## Usage
After installing an extension, you can open UI of the extension by left-clicking the extension icon on the browser toolbar. From there, you will see a list of all open browser tabs on the main panel of the interface. You can select the tabs you want to interact with by checking the corresponding boxes.
